# My Portfolio (React)

This is my react portfolio page. While I don't have much to show off yet, 
I believe I will throughout the next few months and I'm so excited to make 
progress on all of the ideas proposed in the About Me section of this website.

## Usage

This webpage is to be used by future employers and collaborators to examine my work firsthand and to get ot know a little about me. I will continue to keep this page up to date and create better visuals as I progress further along with my learning.
