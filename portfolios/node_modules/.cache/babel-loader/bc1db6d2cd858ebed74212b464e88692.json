My name is Drake Gooding and I'm currently learning to code while living in Mexico, so that's pretty cool. I spend most of my time coding, training Muay Thai, practicing classical guitar, running, or going to the beach.

Of course, I'm just now learning to code so I am hoping to build these projects as I learn more! My ultimate goal is to put my knowlege to the test through implimetation in my own business ventures - hoping ultimately to build a team and run a tech-startup in the music industry. I'd like to venture into learning Swift as well as solidifying my fundamental coding skills. My music startup idea will be blockchain based, so that's something I'd lik to get a broad grip on in order to communicate effectively with blockchain developers. Until then I'll be focused on building my skills on my own, working on coding projects, building my brand a session guitarist for hip hop music, researching physics and calculus, etc. Lots of fun things to work on!
